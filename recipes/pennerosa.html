        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Penne Rosa is a delicious pasta dish consisting of penne noodles tossed in creamy tomatoe sauce, usually accompanied by various vegetables like mushrooms, spinach, diced tomatoes, and garlic. 
            You can also add your choice of meats to it. My personal favorite is thinly sliced steak cooked all the way through. </p>
        <p> My first encounter with penne rosa was in Austin, Texas while working at a restauraunt called Noodles & Company. I've always been a fan of pasta dishes and after trying it the first time
            it quickly became my favorite food dish. I would order it extra spicy with steak every day I worked, and most of my days off. If you enjoy pasta dishes even a little bit, I think this recipe will blow you away.
